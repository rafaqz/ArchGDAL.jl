# ArchGDAL.jl documentation

The latest stable version of the documentation can be viewed at https://yeesian.com/ArchGDAL.jl/stable/. To build a local version of the documentation, navigate to this directory and run the following command:

```shell
$ julia make.jl
```

It should create files in a subdirectory named `build/`. If it builds successfully, you should be able to preview the documentation in a browser by opening `build/index.html` in a browser.
